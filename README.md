# Power BI Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Power BI Projects Portfolio! This repository is a collection of diverse projects demonstrating my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling using Power BI. Each project showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards, well-designed reports, and advanced calculations using DAX.

## üåü **Why This Portfolio?**
This portfolio serves as a platform to exhibit my skills in:
- Building intuitive and interactive Power BI dashboards.
- Designing clean and professional visualizations tailored to specific business requirements.
- Applying advanced data modeling and DAX expressions to derive meaningful insights.
- Crafting solutions for real-world scenarios using publicly available or simulated datasets.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools and Techniques Used**
- **Data Sources**: Excel, CSV files, SQL databases, APIs, and cloud services.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Power Query for data preparation and M Language for custom transformations.
- **Data Modeling**: Star schema designs, relationship management, and calculated columns.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Measures and calculated columns for advanced analytics.
- **Custom Visualizations**: Integration of Power BI‚Äôs default visuals, custom visuals, and slicers for interactivity.
- **Publishing and Sharing**: Power BI Service for online sharing, embedding, and scheduled refresh.

Each project folder contains:
- **`.pbix` File**: The Power BI report file.
- **Data Sources**: Example datasets used in the project.
- **README**: A description of the project, including objectives, datasets, key insights, and visuals.
